<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><b>Scenario
I </b><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">After
an overnight storm has deposited 18 inches of fresh powder on the slopes, the
day is sunny with a temperature of 18øF. At 10:18, you receive the report that
a skier has struck a tree on the skier's left side of a narrow, intermediate
run; just downhill from a shallow mogul field. No further information is
immediately available.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Upon
approaching the scene, you're waved down by a small group gathered near a man
lying in the snow at the base of a tree. The witnesses report seeing the man
lose control in the moguls and veer into the trees to avoid hitting a child. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
injured guest is approximately 30 years old and is responsive. He seems to be in
agony, and is crying out in a foreign language. None of the bystanders know the
patient and none are familiar with the language. The man is covered with snow
that has apparently fallen from the adjacent tree, which is a conifer about 36
inches around.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Taking
a moment to put on sterile gloves, you note that the patient's face is bloody,
with multiple lacerations and a deformed nose. He is struggling to breathe and
exhibiting short, rapid, gurgling breaths. During the rapid survey, the patient
cries out when his left ribs are palpated. Upon exposing the chest, you observe
paradoxical movement of the left chest segment, along with evident contusions
and abrasions of the skin overlying the ribs. At 10:28, the pulse rate is
128/minute and the respiration rate is 36/minute.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Further
assessment reveals instability of the left maxilla, with the left eye beginning
to swell shut. At 10:33, the pulse is 122/minute and respiratory effort is more
labored at 38/minute. Aside from eliciting a response to painful stimuli, you're
unable to establish any other means of communication-although the patient
appears to understand your role as rescuer.<o:p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><b>Scenario
II</b><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">You
are summoned by dispatch to investigate a report of an injured skier in a wooded
section near a black-diamond run.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Approaching
the curve of the slope, you see several people waving frantically on the trail's
edge. While you remove your skis, mark the scene, and put on sterile gloves, the
witnesses recount that a young male skier was moving very fast, lost control,
and then catapulted at a high rate of speed over the slope's edge, up an
embankment, and into the woods. One witness describes hearing the skier strike
at least two trees, and adds that &quot;the sounds were sickening.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When
you approach the skier in the stand of trees, you find that he is lying supine
with his right ski boot lying in his groin against the medial aspect of his
upper right upper thigh. The young man's ski pants are bloody over the outer
aspect of his severely deformed thigh, and there is also blood staining his ski
pants at an angulated area just above his right ski boot.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
skier, who looks to be about 25 years old, is moaning in pain and complains of
severe tingling in his right foot. He is oriented times three and denies loss of
consciousness. A rapid body survey fails to reveal any other obvious injury
except those noted above. Initial vital signs: pulse-116/minute, strong and
regular; respirations-20/minute, deep and halting. Vital signs at 5 minutes:
pulse-112/minute, strong and regular; respirations-18/minute and deep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><b>Scenario
III</b><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It's
a sunny, windless day with all runs open and all lifts in operation. Ticket
sales are at 90 percent capacity as skiers and riders are taking advantage of
packed-powder conditions and no ice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At
2 p.m., dispatch receives a report that a young skier hit lift tower #10 on Sky
Ridge, and, although standing, is stuck in the well around the tower. You are
dispatched to the scene.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Upon
arriving at the scene and discovering that there are actually two injured guests
present, you alert the dispatcher that additional help may be necessary. You
remove your skis and mark the incident site, making a mental note that the lift
tower is fully padded. You also take note of the following information: (1) The
first patient is a young female around 10 years old. Her face is covered in
blood and she is bleeding from the forehead. Conscious and responsive, she is
standing awkwardly in the <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">2-foot-deep
tower well and complaining that her leg is stuck. Both skis are off. (2) The
second patient, also female, is a 12- or 13-year old snowboarder. She looks
dazed and is sitting up in the snow, holding her jaw.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Donning
sterile gloves, you hand the first girl a 4 x 4-inch gauze pad and instruct her
to hold it firmly on her laceration, which she says she received when she cut
her head on her ski while trying to get out of the well. Other than being stuck
and suffering some minor bleeding, the first girl does not have any other
complaints.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">You
then turn your attention to the second girl, who is wincing and appears to be in
a great deal of pain. Mumbling as she describes the incident, she tells you that
the younger girl veered off the trail and fell into the tower well and that she
fell shortly afterwards, coming to rest just above the other girl. Focusing on
her face, you notice that she has braces and is bleeding slightly from the
mouth. Noticing a strong smell of alcohol on her breath you inquire about her
age and learn she is 13. Upon questioning, she admits to drinking some beer with
her friends earlier.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Her
jaw is noticeably offset and the teeth do not align. She is breathing normally
and in answer to your questions says she is not taking any medications and that
she ate lunch about an hour previous.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">You
further learn that the snowboarder fell face-first, hitting her lower jaw fairly
hard, first on her knee and then on the snow. She did not hit the skier or the
tower and her board is still attached to her feet.<o:p>
