<!--
    The original version comparisonMethod by Maven 2 is called "maven".  Which only uses numeric sorting for the 
    first 3 fields (Major,Minor,incremental), but we can use 4 fields, the last one being a build #.
    The problem is that the 4th field is alphabetically sorted.  Which sorts a 5 later than 56.
    The "mercury" method, will first try a numeric sorting for all fields
