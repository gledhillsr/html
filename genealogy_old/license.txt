COMMERCIAL LICENSE: 
The Next Generation of Genealogy Sitebuilding
by Darrin Lythgoe

- The Next Generation of Genealogy Sitebuilding ("the software") may be installed on one public-facing web site only. If the software is 
installed on two different sites (ie, www.thissite.com and www.thatsite.com) then an extra license is required. The software may be 
installed multiple times on the same site (ie, www.mysite.com/this and www.mysite.com/that) without requiring an extra licence. The software may
also be installed on the user's private computer without requiring an extra license if that computer is not connected to the Internet.

- You (the software owner) may make changes to the code as desired, but you may not redistribute any part of the software under any name for any price.

- You may set up "user" accounts (as defined in the TNG Admin section) for various other users, and you may charge a fee for 
usage if desired. If the software is installed multiple times on the same site so that each additional user may have exclusive access, then an additional license is
required for each additional user (despite conditions set forth in first point above). 

I'm no legal eagle, but that's it in a nutshell.
