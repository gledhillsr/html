<h1>Express Setup</h1>
<br>
<h2>For Advanced Users</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Unzip the file somewhere on your hard drive (you've done this already). Depending on the utility you're using,
	you may need to select the "folders" option. You should end up with three subfolders (admin, English, samples).</li>
	<li>Edit the style sheet genstyle.css to make changes to the overall look and feel. This is not necessary, and can
	be done later if desired. An alternate style sheet (genstyle2.css) is also included, but you must rename it to genstyle.css to use it instead. </li>
	<li>Edit the custom header (topmenu.html), footer (footer.html) and HEAD insert (meta.html) as needed.</li>
	<li>Give 666 permissions to the files genlog.txt, config.php and pedconfig.php.</li>
	<li>Create a new folder on your web site (called "genealogy" in these instructions) and FTP over all files NOT in a subfolder.</li>
	<li>Create remote subfolders called "photos", "histories", "headstones", "gendex" and "backups". Give all these 777 permissions.</li>
	<li>Create other remote subfolders called "admin" and "English".</li>
	<li>FTP over the contents of the admin and English subfolders into the ones you just created.</li>
	<li>If you are not your own site administrator (you're using a hosting provider), you can skip this step. 
	Otherwise, please make sure that your php.ini file contains the following settings: register_globals = ON, 
	short_open_tag = ON, file_uploads = ON, and error_reporting = 2039 (or any value not including E_NOTICE). 
	If you make changes to your php.ini file, you must restart your PHP service before the changes take effect.</li>
	<li>Open your web browser and go to http://yoursite/genealogy/admin/setup.php. From there go to the General Settings
	and configure your TNG setup. Click on the Help link there for more information about each of the items listed.</li>
	<li>Also configure the Pedigree Settings if desired (can be done later).</li>
	<li>From the setup page, choose "Create Tables". If you see an error message, your database configuration is incorrect.</li>
	<li>Go to the Administration page (See link at the top of the setup page).</li>
	<li>Set up a "Tree" for each independent GEDCOM you plan to import or independent data set you plan to maintain.</li>
	<li>Set up Users and add permissions to each user profile. The first user you create must be the Administrator (all
	rights, no tree). If you do not want to add users, you should password-protect the admin folder.</li>
	<li>If you plan to use any event types that TNG does not call "Standard", you must set them up here under "Custom 
	Event Types". You can do this first, or you can wait until after your initial GEDCOM import. TNG will catch any
	non-standard event types but will flag them as "Ignore". You can then make changes and re-import.</li>
	<li>If you have a GEDCOM to import, use the Data Import section to import it. If your file is large, you should
	FTP it to your admin folder before attempting the import.</li>
	<li>If you plan to enter data manually, use the Administration options to create People and link them together in 
	Families. Also add Sources where applicable.</li>
	<li>Under Secondary Processes, create a GENDEX file if desired. Also track your lines of descent.</li>
	<li>Use the Admin menu to upload and link Photos, Histories and Headstones to individuals as needed.</li>
