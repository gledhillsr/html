  <h2><center>Overview Brighton Ski Patrol 2020/2021 Training</center></h2>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> With the COVID 19 pandemic still impacting the world we realize not everyone will be able to patrol this year. Please let <a href="mailto:david.koenig@att.net">David Koenig</a> know if you will be taking the year off so he can get a count on the number of patrollers we will have this year.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>CPR will require everyone to take the written test. A few patrollers will need to demonstrate their CPR skills and will be notified by <a href="mailto:npit@sisna.com">Nancy</a> and  <a href="mailto:www.skiback@yahoo.com">Jeff</a>. A date will be set when the COVID 19 numbers look better.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This 2020/2021 refresher will be based on OEC6. See <a href="https://www.nsp.org/NSPMember/For_Members/NSP_Member_Home/OEC_edition_6.aspx" target="_blank">OEC_edition_6</a> for instructions on how to order. Unfortunately there is no additional discount for ordering in bulk so everyone will need to order their own manual which is 25% off plus free shipping. You can also choose an e-book at half the cost of the printed version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patrollers will be refreshing online this year during October, general dates are below and specifics will follow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* October 1-15th - everyone will work on their refresher workbook and online module&nbsp;</p>
  <p>* October 15-31st - will include online lift evac PowerPoint review and online courses for new COVID 19 protocols we will be following this year.&nbsp;</p>
