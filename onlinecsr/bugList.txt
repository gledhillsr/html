========= general Issues==================================
* actually send "reminders" when AMC requests ask (extra program to check each morning)
-----
*in Order Services: make form work really send mail TO: admin@online-csr.com
*in Login: actually send Mail to requested people (except in demo mode) to
	the people on the "Notify About Logins" list
*in Login: increment the login count of the user (in demo mode increment "guest" count)
	(note: in demo mode, the login screen can be by passed, so no increment will be done)
*in Agent Application: make form work really send mail TO: agentmgr@online-csr.com
*in Feedback: make form work really send mail TO: agentmgr@online-csr.com
**in Line Inventory: display stops early at 50 records (if between 50 & 100)
*in Line Inventory: add [add] to the AMC column & go directly to Add Request and have that BTN selected
*in Line Inventory:if click on the AMC "red dot" from the Line Inventory Manager go to the AMC, and list ONLY the AMC's
	for that BTN.
*? in AMC manager, do you really want to waste display space displaying "Sent to:" 
    (this could be multi-lines) when they will all usually all be the same & it was 
    done on the edit screen.
*in New/Edit Request: fix remind date when not NEW Request (always says 3 days from now)
*in New/Edit Request: actually send Mail to requested people (except in demo mode) when Request is Added/Modified to
	the people on the "Notify About Changes" list
*in New/Edit Request:  set up a "special" was for the employees at carrier sales to modify the Inventroy Managers
	"Review" state of a BTN, without sending an email each and every time the "Review" state is changed?
*in Logoff: does not work.  BUT, do we really need a log off, because shutting down the browser will log off?
*in Archive: make a bogus screen that says, "NO Archive records available", and return to the previous screen

===============================
===== Future Enhancements =====
===============================
*Make Archive Work
  What should be archived ?
  Detail/summary/deleted AMC records/Deleted BTN's/???
      THIS SHOULD BE DECIDED ASAP, so any deleted records are not discarded (like they
	  currently are), but can be stored in a "Archive" area.
