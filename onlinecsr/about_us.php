<p><b>ONLINE-CSR™</b>, Inc. is an Application Service Provider.&nbsp; Our mission is to 
provide information to business, government and education customers allowing them 
to more effectively manage their telecommunication services and costs.  Our service is for medium to very large enterprises.  Our clients are customers of the RBOC (Regional Bell Operating Company.)  Qwest is the only RBOC served at this time.


<p>
<font face="Arial" size="3"><b>WHY YOU NEED US<br>
</b>A CSR (customer service record) can only be read by specially trained personnel.  
Even for these trained individuals it is a laborious task.  
Your benefit is that we know the telephone company's systems and how too effectively manage them.  
With ONLINE-CSR's proprietary software, we can read the CSR, convert it to English, summarize it, 
have an expert review it and post the results on our website at a cost previously unobtainable. 
                The database of information allows customers to organize their 
                telecommunication services by division, department, or a single location.  ONLINE-CSR™ puts the customer
                in control of all telecommunication costs. ONLINE-CSR™ simplifies the process
                of moves, adds and changes.  We provide a system where you can input requests for service
                and view the progress on all orders, with automatic e-mail notification on all requests. 

<p>
                
      <p><b>COST OF SERVICE</b><br>
                Our fees are based on the 
                number of CSR's that we are asked to 
                manage.&nbsp; Once your information has been entered into the database,
                your services can easily be reviewed.  Our experts can help you correct
                billing errors and recommend new services that reduce costs.  
                ONLINE-CSR™ will recover any credits for incorrect billing on a contingency fee basis.
                ONLINE-CSR™ offers three distinctive pricing options: Basic Service, Reviewed Service
                and Premium Service.   </p>
