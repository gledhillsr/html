<p>ONLINE-CSR provides Business, Government and Education Customers with
the information they need to control Telecommunication costs, and simplifies the
ordering process for new service and existing services.</p>

<font SIZE="4">
<p>View a simplified, summarized version of your telephone company records.</p>
<p></font><font size="5">Here are the descriptions of each service:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b>SET UP FEES</b> This is the one-time charge to set up 
the customer.&nbsp; This fee is set at $200.00 for all customers and can not be
      waived.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> <font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">ONLINE-CSR™ gives 
the client a picture of what they are being billed for by the RBOC and a tool to 
track orders, adds, moves, changes and inquiries. The price is determined by the 
number of CSR's each customer has.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>&nbsp;PREMIUM SERVICE&nbsp; </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This is an
    annual service, the CSR's are entered each month and reviewed for accuracy,
we correct any billing problems and make recommendations of potential upgrades to newer technologies. Each month an
ONLINE-CSR™ expert in Telecommunications billing and
    technology will review the records with the Agent and Customer. This service
includes all labor associated with correcting all billing errors. It does not
include recovery of any overbilling.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>&nbsp;REVIEWED SERVICE&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This is an
    annual service, the CSR's are entered each month and reviewed for accuracy,
we correct any billing problems and make recommendations of potential upgrades to newer technologies. Each month an
ONLINE-CSR™ expert in Telecommunications billing and
    technology will review the records with the Agent and Customer.&nbsp; All
non-revenue generating orders are billed at an hourly rate.</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;<font face="Arial"><b>BASIC SERVICE</b>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">The basic service pulls CSR's twice a year.

</font> We enter the records into the database and charge an hourly rate to
enter the division, department, description of service. For billing review and
technology upgrades we also charge an hourly rate.<font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">
After a change has been made on a 
CSR it is highly recommended that another CSR be pulled to replace the outdated 
record. This would not be necessary if your client has a </font>Premium or
Reviewed Service<font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">.&nbsp; You can have a single CSR
updated</font> for $10 per CSR.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">LABOR

</font></font></b> &nbsp;</p>
<p> Labor is optional except for the
Premium Service. Many times a client will 
have an account manager that is efficient and the need for <font face="Arial">ONLINE-CSR™</font><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica"><font face="Arial">
to follow 
through on an order is not required. We use only senior Account Consultants (AC) 
each with over 20 years RBOC experience.&nbsp; If your client needs some changes made 
on their account, and they are not revenue generating changes, who can they rely 
on to do the work.&nbsp; Disconnects are a prime example, when you place an order for 
a disconnect it is necessary to follow up and make sure the service actually 
gets disconnected. Labor is charged in hour increments.</font></p>
